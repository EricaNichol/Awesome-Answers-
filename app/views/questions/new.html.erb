<h1>Create a question</h1>

<%= render "form" =%>



<%#the form_for helper method can take an active Record object as a first argument for instance, @question which is of class Question. Rails, by convention, will do the folling:
1. IF @ question is not persisted in the database, it will make the action for the form 'questions_path'. It will look for the class name of the passed object (in this case its Questions) and by convention submit to questions_path %>

<%# if you don't pass any option for f.submit it will:
2. If @question is not persisted it will make the button label "Create [object class]"
2. if @question is persisted it will make the button label "Update [object class]"
 %>


  <%# using f.text_field ensures that Rails will use the proper "name" HTML attribute and it will also populate the text field with data if @question title has a value %>
